NetApp has requested a firmware upgrade of the disks. This is causing high latencies as this update causes a recontruction of certain LUNs. We expect it to last at least 48 hours.

The process continues as expected. Possibly during the course of tomorrow the upgrade process will be completed and the system will start working properly.

1﻿0/02/2023

The firmware update process has been completed. High latency connections should begin to be released and return to optimal performance over the next few hours.

S﻿ystems are up. There are no high  latencies and seems to be working fine.
