NetApp has requested a firmware upgrade of the disks. This is causing high latencies as this update causes a recontruction of certain LUNs. We expect it to last at least 48 hours.

* 09/02/2023 *

The process continues as expected. Possibly during the course of tomorrow the upgrade process will be completed and the system will start working properly.

* 10/02/2023 *

The firmware update process has been completed. High latency connections should begin to be released and return to optimal performance over the next few hours.

* 11/02/2023 *

Systems are up. There are no high  latencies and seems to be working fine.
