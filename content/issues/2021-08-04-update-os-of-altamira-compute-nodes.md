A mismatch in some libraries of the compute nodes in Altamira force the OS upgrade in order to solve this problem.

The update of all the nodes was also schedule due to a vulnerability in the Red Hat distributions. 

Almost the entire cluster is update, some nodes can't be updated because are in use.
